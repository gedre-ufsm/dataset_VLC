Code to generate a dataset of VLC transmission.

The main file is square.grc

Turn-on the VLC system in GEDRE.

Run the file "square.grc" to get the files "sent" and "received" (yes, there is no format in this file, can be .dat and will work anyway).

Run the file "adjust_phase_and_sync.py", which will generate the "IQ_data" folder, where you have the .npy files. 
The point of this .py file is, guess what!?, adjust the phase and sync. Besides create many .png with graphs to visual-check and a log file named "output.txt" where it has important information about the GR simulation.

Turn-off the VLC system.
